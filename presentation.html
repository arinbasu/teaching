     <li>Students were provided a challenge to solve a critical appraisal topic</li>
     <li>Students brought their own laptops to work </li>
     <li>Instructor (the presenter) used his own laptop in the classroom</li>
     <li>Students and the instructor worked together in a live coding session</li>
     <li>Students were encourage to ask questions as they got stuck</li>
     <li>The version of "live coding" was to work in the same room working on the same problem</li>
     <li>Students worked in "pairs" that helped each other</li>

     <ul>
     <li>It was modelled after software carpentry principles to merge critical appraisal with computing</li>
     <li>Students needed hand holding </li>
     <li>A web app for critical appraisal was useful</li>
     <li>The grades of the students improved compared with demonstration alone </li>
     <li>Verbal feedback from students suggested they liked this format</li>
     <li>This strategy reduced the need for one on one sessions</li>
